## Environment
``pip install dash``<br>
``pip install jupyter -dash``<br>

http://127.0.0.1:9091/

## Data
Since it is a very preliminary version of the dashboard, 
the data in data folder is incomplete. We would deploy them with complete.

## Instruction & Improvement
**TODO**
1. Multiple Pages
2. More User Friendly
3. UI Design
4. Code Base: Refactor, decoupling, to be more easy to add components.
